And if you&amp;rsquo;re a cat owner, how can you make sure it&amp;rsquo;s you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Cats Have Favorite People?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It might seem hard to believe if you don&amp;rsquo;t own a cat, but many cats do seem to choose a favorite family member. You&amp;rsquo;d think it would be the person who does most of the caring for them, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But actually, the person your cat has the greatest affinity for might not be the person who cares for them the most, who feeds them, or who pays their vet bills!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quite often, a cat&amp;rsquo;s favorite person is someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like cats that much at all! In some cases, it seems like the harder you try to get your cat&amp;rsquo;s affection, the less interested they are. It&amp;rsquo;s the people who avoid them and don&amp;rsquo;t invade their space who might end up being the favorite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signs You&amp;rsquo;re Your Cat&amp;rsquo;s Favorite Person&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;attachment_47509&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-47509&quot; src=&quot;https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sign-that-you-are-favortite-person-compressed.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sign-that-you-are-favortite-person-compressed.jpg 700w, https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sign-that-you-are-favortite-person-compressed-624x416.jpg 624w, https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sign-that-you-are-favortite-person-compressed-540x360.jpg 540w&quot; alt=&quot;hold cat&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-47509&quot;&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-47509&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;If your cat is fully relaxed and falls asleep, that&amp;rsquo;s the ultimate display of trust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cat behavior is quite complex, and cats bond in different ways. Therefore, there are different ways that your feline friend might let you know that you&amp;rsquo;re their favorite. One indication might be if yours is the lap they choose to curl up on when given a choice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And if they fully relax and fall asleep, that&amp;rsquo;s the ultimate display of trust. Equally, if they rub against you and give you affectionate headbutts, known as bunting, it means you&amp;rsquo;re doing something right! Many cats purr when they&amp;rsquo;re around their favorite family member.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another way you&amp;rsquo;ll know is if they&amp;rsquo;re the feline&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cats.com/clingy-cat-10-signs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;version of your shadow&lt;/a&gt;, and you can&amp;rsquo;t do anything around the house without them keeping you company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Do Cats Choose Favorite People?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When cats choose their favorite person, it&amp;rsquo;s a sign of trust. For them, being around or even in contact with someone they fully trust means that they can completely relax and rest at ease because they feel safe from harm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After all, if they let their guard down, they&amp;rsquo;re relying on you to protect them. But being your cat&amp;rsquo;s favorite human doesn&amp;rsquo;t just mean being a safe place to sleep, you&amp;rsquo;re also someone they can enjoy having fun with during playtime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Help Your Cat Trust You More?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want your cat to trust you more, try to read their body language. If they&amp;rsquo;re flicking their tail or have their ears back, they don&amp;rsquo;t want to be approached. If you barge straight up to them or grab them for a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cats.com/do-cats-like-hugs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cuddle&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at a time like this, you won&amp;rsquo;t get a great response!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s far better to wait until they&amp;rsquo;re showing signs of wanting to interact by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cats.com/cat-chirping&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;chirruping&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at you,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cats.com/what-does-it-mean-when-a-cat-rubs-against-you&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;rubbing against you&lt;/a&gt;, or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cats.com/why-do-cats-purr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;purring&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s always best to let them approach you, and you can even buy some &amp;lsquo;cupboard love&amp;rsquo; with a treat or two as positive reinforcement when they come to you for a cuddle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you watch your cat&amp;rsquo;s behavior, you can also work out what they enjoy doing. When you know what activities or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cats.com/best-cat-toys&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cat toys&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;your cat loves, you can try to share these moments with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also a good idea to acknowledge your&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cats.com/what-do-cats-hate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cat&amp;rsquo;s dislikes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and modify your own behavior. Try to be calmer and quieter when your cat is around and avoid sudden loud noises or big movements that might put them on edge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can also enhance this calming effect by using calming sprays and diffusers, some of which will even help to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cats.com/how-to-bond-with-your-cat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;solidify your cat&amp;rsquo;s bond with you&lt;/a&gt;. You can find calming products like Pet Remedy and Feliway on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, you should create a safe space for your cat. If your cat retreats to this space, you should respect their desire for alone time. Remember, each time you respect your cat&amp;rsquo;s communication and acknowledge their body language; you show them that you understand them and can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to be their feline&amp;rsquo;s favorite family member. Especially if you&amp;rsquo;re a cat lover, it&amp;rsquo;s natural to want to feel the love is reciprocated. It can feel a bit offensive if you do everything to keep your purry puss happy, but they choose someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t even like cats to be their favorite!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t take it personally, though; there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of room for your friendly feline to love you as well. If you spend some time responding to their body language, you can develop a strong bond, and, who knows, you might even become their new favorite in the family!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;cliverse-post-faq&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;');


INSERT INTO blog_posts(author_id, create_time, post_title, post_body) VALUES (1, '2024-02-06 15:02:18', '5 Reasons Why Cats Hate Water', '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cats.com/are-cats-afraid-of-water&quot;&gt;Cats.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not all cats hate water. Some cats love nothing more than chasing a stream of water down the pavement or sticking their paw in a fishbowl. Moving water can be a source of fascination for many cats. But as a rule, almost all pet cats hate getting wet. So, why do our cats feel so differently from their tiger cousins?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Their Wild Cat Ancestors Lived in the Desert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your cat&amp;rsquo;s ancestors lived in dry, desert lands where they would have had very little contact with water. This is why, even thousands of years later, your cat copes so well in the heat and doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to drink a lot compared to other pets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts believe it might also explain why they show such an aversion to getting wet. Their ancestors had little need (or opportunity) to enter the water, so your cat just hasn&amp;rsquo;t evolved to be a water baby. They&amp;rsquo;re probably far happier sunning themselves on a nice warm day!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Wet Coats Are Uncomfortable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cats haven&amp;rsquo;t evolved to spend time in water, so neither has their fur. &amp;nbsp;When cats get wet, their fur absorbs the water and becomes heavy&amp;mdash;a bit like walking around wearing a big wet coat. As cats love to be agile and spend a lot of time grooming, a wet coat can be very uncomfortable and restrictive. They also take a long time to dry out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All in all, your cat would rather stay dry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Getting Wet Removes Their Natural Scent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;attachment_57907&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-57907&quot; src=&quot;https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bathing-cat-compressed.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bathing-cat-compressed.jpg 700w, https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bathing-cat-compressed-624x389.jpg 624w&quot; alt=&quot;Owner gently giving a Bengal cat a bath&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;623&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-57907&quot;&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-57907&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Getting wet makes cats&amp;rsquo; coats heavy and washes away familiar scents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cats have scent glands all over their bodies. These glands secrete pheromones that are unique to your cat and signal different things. For instance, when your&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cats.com/what-does-it-mean-when-a-cat-rubs-against-you&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cat rubs up against you&lt;/a&gt;, they are leaving a message to themselves that you are a friend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cats.com/cat-pheromones&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pheromones&lt;/a&gt; are important to your cat and play a vital role in how they communicate with the world around them. Getting submerged in water can remove these special smells that they spend so long spreading around, which can be disorientating and confusing for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Their Sensitive Sense of Smell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to producing a huge array of pheromonal smells, cats are also extremely good at detecting them. They have approximately forty times more scent receptors in their nose than we do. This means they can sniff out all sorts of chemicals and dissolved substances in tap water that we couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly detect, which may be off-putting to our fussy felines. Their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cats.com/do-cats-have-a-good-sense-of-smell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sensitive nose&lt;/a&gt; is thought to be another reason why cats seem to hate water so much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Negative Experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As well as inheriting traits from their desert-dwelling ancestors, cats are impacted by experiences in their own lifetimes. Your cat might hate the idea of water because they had a shock in the past falling in the bathtub or being squirted with a water gun. Of course, not all cats who dislike water have had a bad experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And not all cats hate water&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Cat Breeds Love Water?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some breeds of cats break the rules when it comes to water, and I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about tigers. Some of these breeds have an unusual affinity to water because they are known for their outgoing and inquisitive personalities, like Bengals. Others (such as the Turkish Van) have special water-resistant coats that make getting wet more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, every cat is an individual. Even most Turkish Van cats (nicknamed &amp;lsquo;The Swimming Cat&amp;rsquo; due to their unusual love of swimming) do not usually enjoy taking a bath.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can You Teach a Cat To Love Water?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;attachment_56157&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-56157&quot; src=&quot;https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cat-playing-water-compressed.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cat-playing-water-compressed.jpg 700w, https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cat-playing-water-compressed-624x416.jpg 624w, https://cats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cat-playing-water-compressed-540x360.jpg 540w&quot; alt=&quot;Cat joyfully engaging with water during playtime&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-56157&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some cats do seem to have a fascination with water, particularly when it is moving. In this case, you can encourage their natural curiosity with some simple water games. For instance, try putting a few of their favorite treats into a bowl of water for them to fish out. Bottle caps, ping pong balls, and plastic cat toys also work well if they aren&amp;rsquo;t so keen on soggy treats. Equally, many cats are just as entertained by a dripping tap!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, whilst some cats may take pleasure from playing with water, it is very unlikely they will voluntarily enter it (unless they are a breed known for swimming). It&amp;rsquo;s important not to force the issue, as pressuring cats into water can just scare or stress them. There are far more rewarding ways to spend time with your cat than trying to teach them to love water. It just isn&amp;rsquo;t what cats are about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you need to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cats.com/how-to-bathe-a-cat&quot;&gt;bath your cat&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; for example, if recommended by a veterinarian to treat a skin condition, or to remove a noxious substance&amp;mdash;then there are ways to help keep your cat calm during the experience. Use a small tub with a non-slip mat rather than a large bath, keep the water warm and shallow, and dry your cat off with a towel as much as possible afterward to avoid them being cold and wet.&lt;/p&gt;')
